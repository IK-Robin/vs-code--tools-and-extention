Absolutely! You can use the Find and Replace functionality in VS Code to achieve this in just a few steps. Here's how you can add a comma after the end of each line that contains id attributes in HTML:

Open the file containing your HTML code in VS Code.

Press Ctrl + F (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + F (Mac) to open the Find widget.

Click the three dots (...) on the left side of the Find widget to expand the advanced options.

Check the box next to the .* button to enable regular expressions in the Find widget.

In the Find input field, type in the following regular expression to match id attributes:

bash
Copy code
id="[^"]+"id="[^"]+"

In the Replace input field, type:

ruby
Copy code
$&
,
This will replace each matched id attribute with itself ($&) followed by a comma ,.

Press Alt + Enter (Windows/Linux) or Option + Enter (Mac) to replace all occurrences or use Alt + R (Windows/Linux) or Option + Command + Enter (Mac) to replace them one by one.

This process will find all occurrences of id attributes in your HTML code and add a comma at the end of each line. Always ensure you have a backup of your code or use version control systems like Git to track changes before performing bulk replacements.
